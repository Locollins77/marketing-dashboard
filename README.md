# Marketing Dashboard

Unified marketing dashboard + AI texting system. Pulls WhatConverts, Hatch, Google Ads,
Meta Ads, and LeadPerfection into one view of the customer journey (ad click → form →
CRM → call → text → conversion), then (Phase 2+) closes the loop with AI-drafted texts
logged back into LeadPerfection.

See `marketing-dashboard-project-brief.txt` (not committed — kept locally) for the full
architecture and phased build plan this repo follows.

## Status: Phase 0 — site scaffold

This phase has no live API integrations. Every number on screen comes from
`server/seed.js`, which populates the DB with mock campaigns, leads, journey events,
calls, and texts matching the data model below. The goal is to get navigation, layout,
auth, and styling solid before wiring in real platforms one at a time.

## Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **DB:** PostgreSQL (`pg`) — Render's filesystem is ephemeral and resets on every
  deploy, so SQLite can't be used there; Postgres is the DB in both local dev and prod
- **Sessions:** stored in Postgres too (`connect-pg-simple`), so logins survive restarts/redeploys
- **Frontend:** Plain HTML/CSS/JS served as static files by Express
- **Auth:** Single internal user, session cookie (`express-session`), password hashed with bcrypt
- **Hosting:** Render, auto-deploying on push to this repo, with a Render managed Postgres instance

## Data model

- `leads` — id, source_platform, source_campaign, contact_info, created_at, lead_perfection_id, status
- `campaigns` — id, platform, name, spend, clicks, conversions, date
- `calls` — id, lead_id, call_recording_url, transcript, duration, call_date
- `texts` — id, lead_id, direction, message, sent_at, ai_generated
- `journey_events` — id, lead_id, event_type, timestamp, metadata (JSON)

## Setup

Requires Node.js (LTS), npm, and a Postgres database to connect to (a local Postgres
install, or the "External Database URL" from a Render Postgres instance both work fine
for development).

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set `DATABASE_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `ADMIN_USERNAME`, and
`ADMIN_PASSWORD` to your own values.

```bash
npm run seed
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and sign in with the admin credentials from `.env`.

## Deploying on Render

1. In the Render dashboard, add a **Postgres** instance (free tier is fine for this
   volume). Copy its **Internal Database URL**.
2. On the web service for this repo, set environment variables: `DATABASE_URL` (the
   internal URL from step 1), `SESSION_SECRET`, `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
3. Build command: `npm install`. Start command: `npm start`.
4. After the first deploy succeeds, run `npm run seed` once (Render's Shell tab, or a
   one-off job) to create the admin user and mock data against the new database.

## Project structure

```
server/
  index.js            Express app entrypoint, session + static + route wiring
  db.js               Postgres pool + schema (server/db.js)
  seed.js             Mock data generator (npm run seed)
  asyncHandler.js     wraps async route handlers so rejected promises reach the error handler
  routes/
    auth.js           login / logout / session
    overview.js        spend, leads, conversions by source
    leads.js           lead list + full journey detail
  middleware/
    requireAuth.js     gates /api/* and page routes behind session login
public/
  login.html, index.html (Overview), leads.html, lead-detail.html
  css/style.css
  js/                 one file per page, plus shared nav.js
```

## Next steps (Phase 1+)

1. Connect WhatConverts, Google Ads, Meta Ads via scheduled sync jobs, replacing the
   mock data source with real upserts into the same tables.
2. Call LeadPerfection's `GetLeadSourceValidParameters` to get valid `businessID` /
   `promoterID` / `productsold` codes, then wire the write path: new leads →
   `POST /api/Leads/AddProspect`.
3. Sync LeadPerfection's `GetProspectData` / `GetLead` back into the DB to reflect
   CRM status changes in the journey view.
4. Connect Hatch for call recordings/transcripts.
5. Phase 4: AI transcript analysis + AI-drafted texts, gated on LeadPerfection's DNC
   (`T` = Do Not Text) flag via `UpdateDNCStatus`, with STOP/opt-out handling before
   anything sends live (TCPA compliance).
